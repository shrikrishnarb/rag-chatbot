# RAG: AI-Powered Document Understanding Assistant

**RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a smart AI assistant built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Python**. It reads long and complex documents like:

-  Resumes
-  Insurance policies
-  Terms & conditions
-  Legal agreements

…and explains them in **simple, human-friendly language**.

---

##  What It Can Do

-  Understand and summarize **resumes**
-  Break down hard **insurance clauses**
-  Highlight **risky terms in agreements**
-  Help non-experts decide: “Should I sign this?”
-  Explain technical jargon in plain English

cd rag
```
###  2. Create .env file:

##  Folder Structure
```bash
rag/
├── app.py           # Main chatbot logic
├── .env             # API keys (kept secret)
├── .gitignore       # Hides private files
├── README.md        # This file
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies

```

##  Security Warning
⚠️ Never commit your .env file to GitHub — it contains your secret API key.
You’re already protected by .gitignore.

##  Future Plans
-Add Streamlit UI for uploads
-Add PDF upload + real-time Q&A
-Highlight risky or unclear clauses
-Add voice-based chat for accessibility
-Support Japanese 🇯🇵 and other languages
