The history of computer development represents the \nculmination of years of technological advancements beginning with the early ideas of \nCharles Babbage and eventual creation of the first computer by German engineer Konard \nZeise in 1941. The whole process involved a sequence of changes from one type of \nphysical realization to another from gears to relays to valves to transistors to integrated \ncircuits to chip and so on. Surprisingly however, the high speed modern computer is \nfundamentally no different from its gargantuan 30 ton ancestors which were equipped \nwith some 18000 vacuum tubes and 500 miles of wiring. Although computers have \nbecome more compact and considerably faster in performing their task, the task remains \nthe same: to manipulate and interpret an encoding of binary bits into a useful \ncomputational result. \n \n      The number of atoms needed to represent a bit of memory has been decreasing \nexponentially since 1950. An observation by Gordon Moore in 1965 laid the foundations \nfor what came to be known as “Moore’s Law” – that computer processing power doubles \nevery eighteen months. If Moore’s Law is extrapolated naively to the future, it is learnt \nthat sooner or later, each bit of information should be encoded by a physical system of \nsubatomic size. As a matter of fact this point is substantiated by the survey made by \nKeyes in 1988 as shown in fig. 1. This plot shows the number of electrons required to \nstore a single bit of information. An extrapolation of the plot suggests that we might be \nwithin the reach of atomic scale computations with in a decade or so at the atomic scale \nhowever. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Year  \n \n \n   Fig 1:  Showing number of dopant impurities in logic in bipolar transistors with year. \n \n \n1014 \n     \n1012 \n \n1010 \n \n108 \n \n106 \n \n104 \n \n102 \n \n1 \n \n1950    1970    1980    1990    2000    2010\nNo. Of \nImpurities"

    "text": "7\n \n \nCHAPTER 2  \n \nLITERATURE SURVEY \n \n2.1 A BRIEF HISTORY OF QUANTUM COMPUTING: \n \n         The idea of computational device based on quantum mechanics was first explored \nin the 1970’s and early 1980’s by physicists and computer scientists such as Charles H. \nBennet of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Centre, Paul A. Beniof of Arogonne \nNational Laboratory in Illinois, David Deustch of the University of Oxford and Richard \nP. Feynman of Caltech. The idea emerged when scientists were pondering on the \nfundamental limits of computation. In 1982 Feynman was among the fewer to attempt to \nprovide conceptually a new kind of computers which could be devised based on the \nprinciples of quantum physics. He constructed an abstract model to show how a quantum \nsystem could be used to do computations and also explain how such a machine would be \nable to act as a simulator for physical problems pertaining to quantum physics. In other \nwords, a physicist would have the ability to carry out experiments in quantum physics \ninside a quantum mechanical computer. Feynman further analysed that quantum \ncomputers can solve quantum mechanical many body problems that are impractical to \nsolve on a classical computer. This is due to the fact that solutions on a classical \ncomputer would require exponentially growing time where as the whole calculations on \nquantum computer can be done in polynomial time. \n          \n        Later, in 1985, Deutsch realized that Feynman assertion could eventually lead to a \ngeneral-purpose quantum computer. He showed that any physical process, in principle \ncould be modelled perfectly by a quantum computer. Thus, a quantum computer would \nhave capabilities far beyond those of any traditional classical computer. Consequently \nefforts were made to find interesting applications for such a machine. This did not lead to \nmuch success except continuing few mathematical problems. Peter Shor in 1994 set out a \nmethod for using quantum computers to crack an important problem in number theory \nwhich was namely factorisation. He showed how an ensemble of mathematical \noperations, designed specifically for a quantum computer could be organized to make \nsuch a machine to factor huge numbers extremely rapidly, much faster than is possible on \nconventional computers. With this breakthrough, quantum computing transformed from a \nmere academic curiosity directly to an interest world over. \n          \n        Perhaps the most astonishing fact about quantum computing is that it took \nexceedingly large time to take off. Physicists have known since 1920’s that the world of \nsubatomic particles is a realm apart, but it took computer scientists another half century \nto begin wondering whether quantum effects might be harnessed for computation. The \nanswer was far from obvious."

    "text": "8\n2.2 LIMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL COMPUTER AND BIRTH OF ART OF QUANTUM \nCOMPUTING \n \n2.2.1:  Public Key Cryptography and Classical factoring of big integers: \n \n          In 1970 a clever mathematical discovery in the shape of “public key” systems \nprovided a solution to key distribution problem. In these systems users do not need to \nagree on a secret key before they send the message. The principle of a safe with two keys, \none public key to lock it, and another private one to open it, is employed. Everyone has a \nkey to lock the safe but one person has a key that will open it again, so anyone can put a \nmessage in the safe but only one person can take it out. In practice the two keys are two \nlarge integer numbers. One can easily derive a public key from a private key but not vice \nversa. The system exploits the fact that certain mathematical operations are easier to \nperform in one direction that the other e.g. multiplication of numbers can be performed \nmuch faster than factorising a large number. What really counts for a “fast” algorithm is \nnot the actual time taken to multiply a particular pairs of numbers but the fact that the \ntime does not increase too sharply when we apply the same method to ever-large \nnumbers. We know that multiplication requires little extra time when we switch from two \nthree digit numbers to two thirty digit numbers using the simpler trial division method \nabout 10∧13 times more time or memory consuming than factoring a three digit number. \nIn case of factorisation the use of computational resources is enormous when we keep on \nincreasing the number of digits. As a matter of fact public key cryptosystems could avoid \nkey distribution problem. However their security depends upon unproven mathematical \nassumptions such as the difficulty of factoring large integers. Nevertheless one such \nprotocol is RSA, which maps electronic banking possible by assuming banks and their \ncustomers that a bogus transfer of funds or a successful forgery would take the world’s \nfastest computer millions of years to carry out. Another is the under spread Data \nEncryption Standard (DES) which remains secure far most ordinary business \ntransactions.  \n \n          The procedure of factorising a large integer can be quantified as follows. Consider \na number N with L decimal digits (N ~ 10 to power L). The number is factored using trial \ndivision method. On conventional computers one of well known factoring algorithm runs \nfor number of operations of the order of  \n \ns ~ O (exp ( (64/9)1/3 (lnN)1/3 (ln lnN)2/3 )) \nor explicitly,   \ns ~ A exp ( 1.9 L1/3 ( lnL)2/3 ) \n \n \nThis algorithm therefore, scales exponentially with the input size log N (log N determines \nthe length of the input. The base of the logarithm is determined by our numbering system. \nThus base 2 gives the length in binary, a base 2 gives the length in binary, a base of 10 in \ndecimal and so on) e.g. in 1994 a 129 digit number (known as RSA 129) was successfully \nfactored using this algorithm on approximately 1600 workstations scattered around the \nworld, the entire factorisation took eight months. Using this to estimate the per factor of \nthe above exponential scaling, it is found that it would take roughly 800,000 years to \nfactor a 250 digit number with the same computer power, similarly a 1000 digit number \nwould require 10 to the power 25 years (much longer than the age of universe). The \ndifficulty of factoring large numbers is crucial for public key cryptography such as used"

Using the trial division method for factorisation 10L/2 (=√N) \ndivisions are needed to solve the problem on exponential increase as function of L. \nSuppose a computer performs 1010 decisions per second. Thus the computer can factor \nany number N, in about e.g. a 100 digit number will be factored in 1040 seconds, much \nlonger than 3.8 X 1017 second (12 billion years), the currently estimated age of the \nuniverse! \n2.2.2 Quantum Factoring  \n \n        From the analysis of classical factoring of big integers it seems that factoring big \nnumbers will remain beyond the capabilities of any realistic computing devices and \nunless mathematicians or computer scientists come up with an efficient factoring \nalgorithm, the public key crypto systems will remain secure. However it turns out that \nthis is not the case. The Classical Theory of Computation is not complete simply because \nit does not describe all physically possible computations. In particular, it does not \ndescribe computations, which can be performed by quantum devices. Indeed, recent work \nin quantum computation shows that a quantum computer can factor much faster than any \nclassical computer. According to an algorithm developed by Peter Shor factoring an \ninteger using quantum computer runs in O((lnN) 2+ε) steps, where ε is small. This is \nroughly quadratic in the input size, so factoring a 1000 digit number with such an \nalgorithm would require only few million steps. The implication is that public key \ncryptosystems based on factoring may be breakable. \n \n2.2.3 Searching of an item with desired property: \n \n      Searching of an item with desired property from a collection of N items is another \nproblem that admits tremendous speed up using quantum logic based algorithm. Suppose \nwe pick up an item at random from a collection of N items likelihood of correct selection \nis the same as that of right one, the probability of right selection is half. Hence on an \naverage we require N/2 operations for getting the right item. However Grover invented \nquantum logic based algorithm, which accomplishes the same task in an average of √ N \nnumber of operations. \n \n2.2.4 Simulation of quantum system by classical computer: \n \n        Richard P. Feynman, in 1982 proposed that a quantum physical system of N \nparticles with its quantum probabilities can not be simulated by the usual computer \nwithout an exponential slowdown in the efficiency of simulation. However, a system of \nN particles in classical physics can be simulated with a polynomial slowdown. The main \nreason for this is that the description size of a particle system is linear in N in classical \nphysics but exponential in N according to quantum computer (computer based on the \nlaws of quantum mechanics) can avoid the slowdown encountered in the simulation \nprocess of quantum systems. Feynman also addressed the problem of simulating a \nquantum physical system with a probabilistic computer but due to interference \nphenomena, it appears to be a difficult problem."

The difficulty is not so much that \nmicroprocessors are too slow; it is that computers are inherently inefficient. Modern \n(classical) computers operate according to programs that divide a task into elementary \noperations, which are then carried out serially, one operation at a time. Efforts have been \nmade to coax two or more computers (or at least two or more microprocessors) to work \non different aspects of a problem at the same time, but the progress in such parallel \ncomputing has been slow and fitful. The reason to a large extent is that the logic built into \nmicroprocessors is inherently serial (normal computers sometimes appear to be doing \nmany tasks at once, such as running both a word processor and spreadsheet programme, \nbut in reality, the central processor is simply cycling rapidly from one task to the next).  \n \n       In a true sense, parallel computer would have simultaneity built into its very nature. \nIt would be able to carry out many operations at once, to search instantly through a long \nlist of possibilities and point out the one that solves the problem. Such computers do \nexist. They are called quantum computers. In reality, the more exciting feature of \nquantum computing is quantum parallelism. A quantum system in general is not in one \n“classical state” but in a “quantum state” consisting (broadly speaking) in a superposition \nof many classical or classical like states. This is called principle of linear superposition \nused to construct quantum states. If the superposition can be protected from unwanted \nentanglement with its environment (known as decoherence) a quantum computer can \noutput results depending on details of all its classical like states. This is quantum \nparallelism- parallelism on a serial machine. \n \n2.4 \nQUANTUM \nSUPERPOSITION \nAND \nQUANTUM \nINTERFERENCE: \nConceptual \nvisualization of quantum computer. \n        \n       In a quantum computer the fundamental unit of information (is called a quantum bit \nor “qubit”, analogous to classical bit used in ordinary computer), is not binary but rather \nmore quaternary in nature. This qubit property arises as direct consequence of its \nadherence to the laws of quantum motions. A qubit can exist not only in a state \ncorresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical state bit but also in states \ncorresponding to a blend of superposition of those classical states. In other words a qubit \ncan exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with numerical coefficient \nrepresenting the probability for each state. This concept may appear to be counterintuitive \nbecause every day phenomenon is governed by classical physics, not quantum \nmechanics, which taps out at the atomic level. Physically qubit can be visualized by the \nspin s=1/2 of one electron system, the two state +1/2 and –1/2 being two eigenstates of Sz \n(z component direction of an external magnetic field of spin ½.). Alternatively a beam of \nsingle photon can also be used, the total states being the state of polarization (horizontal \nor vertical) with respect to some chosen axis. Thus qubit can take 2 values, 0 or 1, which \nare associated with two eigenstates of a spin of a single electron (say): \n \n \n \n \n|1> = |↑> \n \n \n \n \n|0> = |↓> \n                                      |0> +  |1> =  |↑> +  |↓>"

In \nmathematical terms, we say that since the general state of a qubit can be superposition of \ntwo pure states with arbitrary complex coefficients, then the state is described as a vector \nin the two dimensional complex space c2 and the two pure states form the basis of the \nrepresentation. \n \n       Experimentally the phenomenon of quantum superposition can be demonstrated as \nfollows. Consider figure 2.  \n                                               \n                                        \n \n \n                                                 Fig 2: Beam splitting of light \n \n \n \nHere a light source emits a photon along a path towards a half-silvered mirror. This \nmirror splits the light, reflecting half vertically toward detector A and transmitting half \ntoward detector B. a photon however represents a single quantised energy state (E=hν) \nand hence cannot be split, so it is detected with equal probability at either A or B. this is \nverified by observation that if the detector A registers the signal than B does not and vice-\nversa. With this piece of information one would like to think that any given photon \ntravels either vertically or horizontally, randomly choosing between the two paths. \nQuantum mechanics however predicts that the photon actually travels both paths \nsimultaneously, collapsing down to one path only upon measurement (collapse of the \nwave function). This effect is known as single-particle interference resulting from the \nlinear superposition of the possible photon states of potential paths. The phenomenon of \nsingle particle interference can be better illustrated in a slightly more elaborate \nexperiment, outlined in fig 3. In this experiment the photon first encounters a half \npolished mirror (beam splitter) thus getting split into two parts: reflected beam and \ntransmitted beam. The two beams are recombined with the half of the fully silvered \nmirrors and finally another half silvered mirror splits before reaching a detector. Each \nhalf silvered mirror introduces the probability of the photon following down one path or \nthe other. Once a photon strikes the mirror along either of two paths after the first beam \nsplitter, the arrangement is identical to that in fig 2 thus a single photon travelling \nvertically, when strikes the mirror, then by the experiment in fig 2, there should be an \nequal probability (50%) that the photon will strike either detector A or detector B. the \nsame goes for a photon travelling down the horizontal path. However, the actual result is \ndrastically different. If the two possible paths are exactly equal in length, then it turns out \nthat there is 100% probability that photon reaches the detector A & 0% probability that it \nreaches the detector B thus the photon is certain to strike the detector A it seems \ninescapable that the photon must, in some sense, have actually travelled both routes \nsimultaneously."

Block of one of \nthe paths actually allows detector B to be reached; with both routes open, the photon \nsomehow knows that it is not permitted to reach detector B, so it must have actually felt \nout both routes. It is therefore perfectly legitimate to say that between the two half \nsilvered mirrors the photon took both transmitted and reflected paths or using more \ntechnical language, we can say that photon is in a coherent superposition of being in the \ntransmitted beam and in the reflected beam. This quantum interference is resulting due to \nlinear superposition principle. This is one of those unique characteristics that make \ncurrent research in quantum computing not merely a continuation of today’s idea of \ncomputer but rather an entirely new branch of thought and underlying concept and it is \nbecause quantum computers harness those special characteristics that gives them the \npotential to be incredibly powerful computational device. \n \n2.5 QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT \n \n        The observation of correlation among various events is day to day phenomena. \nThese correlations are well described with the help of laws of classical physics. Let us \nconsider the following example: Imagine a scene of bank robbery is picturised. The bank \nrobber is pointing a gun at the terrified teller. By looking at the teller one can tell whether \nthe gun has gone off or not if the teller is alive and unharmed, one can be sure the gun has \nnot been fired. If the teller is lying dead of a gunshot wound on the floor, one knows the \ngun has been fired. This is a simple detective case. Thus there is a direct correlation \nbetween the state of gun and the state of the teller ‘gun fired’ means “teller alive”. In the \nevent it is presumed the robber only shots to kill and he never misses. \n \n        In the world of microscopic objects described by quantum mechanics, correlation \namong the events is not so simple. Consider a nucleus which might undergo a radioactive \ndecay in a certain time or it might not. Thus with respect to decay the nucleus exist in two \nV \nH\nFully Silvered\nHalf Silvered \n(Beam splitter) \nB"

    "text": "13\npossible states only: ‘decayed’ and ‘not decayed’, just as we had two states, ‘fired’ and \n‘not fired’ for the gun or ‘alive’ and ‘dead’ for the teller. However, in the quantum \nmechanical world, it is also possible for the atom to be in a combined state decayed-not \ndecayed in which it is neither one nor the other but somewhere in between. This is due to \nthe principle of linear superposition of two quantum mechanical states of the atom, and is \nnot something we normally expect of classical objects like guns or tellers. Further let us \nconsider a system consisting of two nuclei. Two nuclei may be correlated so that if one \nhas decayed, the other will also have decayed. And if one has not decayed, neither has the \nother. This is 100% correlation. However, the nuclei may also be correlated so that if one \nis in the superposition state, ‘decayed-not decayed’, the other will also be. Thus quantum \nmechanically, then one more correlation between nuclei than we would expect \nclassically. This kind of quantum ‘super correlation’ is called ‘Entanglement’. \n \n           Entanglement was in fact originally named German, ‘Verschrankung’, by Erwin \nSchrodinger, a Nobel laureate in physics, for his basic contribution in quantum \nmechanics. Schrodinger was the first to realize the strange character of entanglement. \nImagine it is not the robber but the nucleus, which determines whether the gun fires. If \nthe nucleus decays, it sets off a hair trigger, which fires the gun.  If it does not decay, the \ngun does not fire. But if the nucleus is in the superposition it can be correlated to the gun \nin a superposition state fired-not fired. However such a correlation leads to a catastrophic \nsituation. In the present case teller is dead or alive at the same time! Schrodinger was \nworried about the similar situation where the victim of the quantum entanglement was a \ncat in a box (Schrodinger cat: A paradox). For Schrodinger cat in a box decay nucleus \ncould trigger the release of lethal chemical. The basic problem is that in the everyday \nworld we are not used to see anything like dead-alive cat or dead-alive teller. However, in \nprinciple, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory describing every level of our \nexperience, such strange states should be possible. Where does the quantum world stop \nand the classical world begins? Do we really have an interface separating quantum \nphenomenon from the classical one? And so on. These and allied problems have been \ndescribed since long and in the process a number of different interpretations of quantum \ntheory have been suggested.  \n           \n             The problem was brought into focus by a famous paper in 1935 by Einstein, \nPodolsky and Rosen, who argued that the strange behaviour of entanglement that \nquantum mechanics is an incomplete theory not wrong. This is widely known as EPR \nparadox. The concept of EPR paradox can be understood with the help of following \nexample: consider a Helium atom in the ground state. It has two electrons having \nfollowing quantum numbers: n=1, l=0, s=1/2, sz = +1/2 for one and sz = -1/2 for another. \nThus we have j = 0 & 1. But jz = (sz )1 + (sz )2 = 0. Hence only j=0 state is allowed. Thus \nin a Helium atom, two electrons are antiparallel to each other and hence form entangled \npair of system. The atom is provided sufficient energy (equal to the binding energy of the \natom). So that it disintegrates at rest. Consequently two electrons fly away in opposite \ndirection."

If he wears red coloured sock in one foot, it should be green in the other, or if \nit is yellow in one then it should be blue in the other. Presumably Mr. Bertleman never \nbreaks the rule. Therefore looking at the colour of one sock one can tell the colour of the \nother sock which he is wearing. However on deeper scrutiny, the kind of objection raised \nabove, does not stand. As a matter of fact in quantum entanglement the choice of \nmeasurement also plays a crucial role. One may decide to measure x-component of spin, \nor its y-component or a compound along s direction inclined at an arbitrary angle to x-\naxis. The other particle arranges its spin accordingly. In case of Bertleman’s example the \nonlooker has a role to play. The onlooker once decides to see the yellow-blue \ncombination of colours for Bertleman socks, looks at accordingly the intention of \nonlooker in deciding the colour is interesting and equally interesting is the instant \ncommunication of this intention."

EPR correlations (usually referred as quantum entanglement) predicted by \nquantum mechanics are so strong that one can hardly avoid the conclusion that \nquantum mechanics should be completed by some supplementary parameters \n(those so called hidden variables.) \n2. The elaboration of the above result, demonstrates that the hidden variables \ndescription in fact contradicts some predictions of quantum mechanics. \n \nIn the face of these two perfectly convincing and contradictory results, there is only \none way out: ask Nature how it works.

Quantum \nmechanics allows for the existence of a two-photon state (EPR state) for which the \npolarization measurements taken separately appear random but which are strongly \ncorrelated. More precisely, denoting P+(a) & P-(a) as the probabilities that the \npolarization of ν1 along a is found equal to + or -, these probabilities are predicted to be \nequal to 0.5, similarly the probabilities P+(b) & P-(b) for photon ν2 are equal to 0.5 and \nindependent of the orientation  b. \n                On the other hand, the joint probability P++(a) for observing + for both the \nphotons is equal to 0.5 Cos2(a.b). In case of parallel polarisers [(a.b)=0], this joint \nprobability is P++(0)=0.5, Similarly P--(0). For cross polariser [(a.b)= π/2], the joint \nprobability is P-+( π/2)=P+-(π/2)=0.

Consider for instance, the occurrence of some defined disease (say G) and let us \nassume that biologists have observed its development in 50% of the population aged 20, \nand its absence in the remaining half. Now on investigating specific pair of (true) twin \nbrothers, a perfect correlation is found between the outcomes: if one brother is affected, \nthe other is also found to be inflicted with the disease; but if one member of the pair has \nnot developed the disease, then the other is also unaffected. In face of such perfect \ncorrelation for twin brothers, the biologists will certainly conclude that the disease has a \ngenetic origin. A simple scenario may be invoked: at the first step of conception of the \nembryo, a genetic process which is random in nature, produced a pair of chromosome \nsequence-one which is responsible for the occurrence or absence of the disease that has \nbeen duplicated and given to both brothers. \n        \n         Thus the two situations the case of correlation between the polarized states of two \nphotons and the case of twin brothers (a number of such situations can be exemplified) \nare exactly analogous. It seems therefore, natural to link this correlation between the pairs \nof photons to some common property analogous to the common genome of the two twin \nbrothers. This common property changes form pair to pair, which accounts for the \nrandom character of the single event. This is the basic conclusion drawn by John Bell \nregarding EPR states. A natural generalization of the EPR reasoning leads to the \nconclusion that quantum mechanics is not a complete description of physical reality. As a \nmatter of fact, introduction of “some common property” which changes from pair to pair, \ninvokes the idea that complete description of a pair must include “something” in addition \nto the state vector, which is the same for all pairs. This “something” can be called \nsupplementary parameter or hidden variables. Inclusion of hidden variables sends an \naccount of the polarized states of two photons, for any set (a, b) of orientations. \n \n2.5.2.2 Bell Inequalities \n \n      Bell examined critically the requirement for hidden variables to explain the expected \ncorrelation between the two polarized states of photons. It was shown that the expected \ncorrelations, for the joint measurements of polarized states of photons as mentioned \nabove, cannot take any set of values, but they are subjected to certain constraints. More \nprecisely, if we consider four possible sets of orientations [(a.b), (a.b’), (a’.b), (a’.b’)], \nthe corresponding correlation coefficients (which measure the amount of correlation) are \nrestricted by Bell inequalities which states that a given combination of these four \ncoefficients ‘s’ is between –2 and +2 for any reasonable hidden variable theory. Thus \nBell inequalities prescribe a test for the validity of hidden variable theory. However, \nquantum mechanics predicts the value of s as 2.8 i.e., it violates Bell inequalities, and the \nsame is tested by experiments. Thus the hidden variable theories envisaged above are \nunable to send an account of the EPR correlation (quantum entanglement) predicted by \nquantum mechanics. As a matter of fact quantum mechanical correlations are more \nintricate to understand as compared to mutual correlations between twin brothers. \n           \n           Bell inequality is based on the assumption of local hidden variable models. The \nassumption of locality states that the result of a measurement by a polariser cannot be \ndirectly influenced by the choice of the orientation of the other remotely located \npolariser. Actually this is nothing but the consequence of Einstein causality (No signal \ncan move with a speed greater than speed of light in vacuum). Nevertheless, Bell"

Bell’s theorem can thus be phrased in the following \nway: some quantum mechanical predictions (EPR correlations-quantum entanglement) \ncannot be mimicked by any local realistic model in the spirit of Einstein ideas of theory \nof hidden variables. \n \n2.6 QUANTUM TELEPORTATION AND QUANTUM THEORY OF INFORMATION \n \n        Information is physical and any processing of information is always performed by \nphysical means-an innocent sounding statement, but its consequences are anything but \ntrivial. In the last few years there has been an explosion of theoretical and experimental \ninnovations leading to the creation of a fundamental new discipline: a distinctly Quantum \nTheory of Information. Quantum physics allows the construction of qualitatively new \ntypes of logic gates, absolutely secure cryptosystems (systems that combine \ncommunications and cryptography), the cramming of two bits of information into one \nphysical bit and, has far just been proposed, a son of “teleportation”. \n \n      Until recently teleportation was not taken seriously by scientists. Usually \nteleportation is the name given by science fiction writers to the feat of making an object \nor person disintegrate in one place while a perfect replica appears somewhere else. \nNormally this is done by scanning the object in such a way as to extract all the \ninformation from it, then this information is transmitted to the information from it, then \nthis information is transmitted to the receiving location and used to construct the replica, \nnot necessarily from the actual material of the original, but probably from atoms of the \nsame kinds, arranged in exactly the same pattern as the original. A teleportation machine \nwould be like a fax machine, except that it would work on 3-dimensional objects as well \nas documents, it would produce an exact copy rather an approximate facsimile and it \nwould destroy the original in the process of scanning it. \n \n     In classical physics, an object can be teleported, in principle by performing a \nmeasurement to completely characterize the properties of the object that information can \nthen be sent to another location, and this object reconstructed. Moreover classical \ninformation theory agrees with everyday intuition: if a message is to be sent using an \nobject which can be put into one of N distinguishable states, the maximum number of \ndifferent messages which can be sent is N. For example, single photon can have only two \ndistinguishable polarization states: left handed and right handed. Thus a single photon \ncan not transmit more than two distinguishable messages i.e. one bit of information. \nNotwithstanding the basic question: is it possible to provide a complete reconstruction of \nthe original object? The answer is no. All the physical systems are ultimately quantum \nmechanical and quantum mechanics tells us that it is impossible to completely determine \nthe state of an unknown quantum system, making it impossible to use the classical \nmeasurement procedure to move a quantum system from one location to another. This is \ndue to Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which states that more accurately an object is \nscanned, the more it is disturbed by the scanning process, until one reaches a point where \nthe objects original state has been completely disrupted, still without having extracted \nenough information to make a perfect replica. This sounds like a solid argument against"

Analogous to any physical system, the \nmodern computers based on digital devices produce heat in operation. The basic question \nis: Can digital computers be improved so as to minimize production of heat. It turns out \nthat it is possible to think (consistent with the laws of physics) of an ideal computer \ncapable of shaping, maintaining and moving around digital signals, maintaining and \nmoving around digital signals without any heat generation. Nevertheless there is one \nplace where heat must be produced. Whenever information is erased the phase space \nassociated with the system that stores information shrinks. Erasing a single bit of \ninformation reduces entropy of the system that stored that information by at least \n∆S=klog2. This reduction of entropy results in heat transfer to the environment. \n       \n     Thus if a computer could be constructed that does not erase any information, such a \ncomputer could work without generating any heat at all. This is precisely the situation in \nquantum computers. Quantum Computation is reversible (but not the read out of the \nresult of that computation). It is therefore possible, at least in principle, to carryout \nquantum computation without generating heat. Of course, in reality the computer would \nstill generate a lot of heat. Electric pulses moving along copper wires would have to work \ntheir way against resistance. Electrons diffusing from a source would still collide with \ncrystal imperfections and with electrons in the drain again, generating heat. But at least in \nideal situation, copper wires could be replaced with superconductors, imperfect crystals \nwith prefect ones. \n \n     The reversibility of quantum computers is being realised by conceiving and \nfabricating special gates. In digital computers gate like NOR, AND, NAND and XOR are \nemployed. All these gates are irreversible: they must generate heat. Amount of \ninformation on the right hand side of \n \n \n \n \n  (a,b)  \n      (a∧b) \n \nis less  than the amount of information on the left hand side. Using Toffoli gates Charles \nBennett has demonstrated that quantum computers are capable of performing any \ncomputation utilizing only reversible steps. These special gates maintain all information \nthat is passed to them, so that the computation can be run forward and backward. \nConsequently the computation results in a very large amount of data, because every \nintermediate step is remembered, but heat generation is eliminated which the computation \ngoes on. After the computation is over the computation can be run backwards in order to \nrestore the initial state of the computer and avoid its spontaneous combustion. \n \n2.8 Experimental Realisation of Quantum Computer \n \n       The architectural simplicity makes the quantum computer faster, smaller and cheaper \nbut its conceptual intricacies are posing difficult problems for its experimental \nrealization.

A \npreliminary analysis demonstrated that Fourier transforms can be evaluated with the \nion trap computer.

The computer consists of a QED cavity filled \nwith some cesium atoms and an arrangement of lasers, phase shift detectors, polarizer \nand mirrors. The setup is a true quantum computer because it can create, manipulate \nand preserve superposition and entanglements. \n \n2.8.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance: \n \n     A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) computer consists of a capsule filled with \na liquid and an NMR machine. Each molecule in the liquid is an independent \nquantum memory register. Computation proceeds by sending radio pulses to the \nsample and reading its response. Qubits are implemented as spin states of the nuclei \nof atoms comprising the molecules. In an NMR computer the readout of the memory \nregister is accomplished by a measurement performed on a statistical ensemble of \nsay, 2.7x1019 molecules.

The scientist wrote about the potential for nanoscience in an \ninfluential 1959 talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” thus ushering a new \nera of the field of low dimensional materials. One thing common about all the \nconducting nanomaterials is that, in spite of the contraction in the size of the material, \nthe basic characteristics of the material remains the same- the energy levels remain \nthe same. This fact remains true as long as the size of the material undergoes \nnoticeable change. The number of energy levels increases and they start shifting \ntowards ‘blue’ region. By this, it is meant that the wavelength is smaller than green, \nyellow, orange and red. But with the decrease in wavelength, the frequency increases. \n \nNow we know that the energy level E is given by the equation: \n \n                       E = h ν where h: Planck’s constant and ν is frequency. \n \nAs the frequency increases by shifting towards blue, the energy increases. Therefore, \nthese materials are capable of storing more energy and are said to exhibit \nnanoproperty. The cause of the above said phenomena is stated below: \n \nThere is a wavelength called Compton Wavelength, which decides at which energy \nlevels of the materials change. \n \nλc = h/ (m0 * c) \nh: Planck’s constant \nm0: rest mass \nc: velocity of light. \n \nIf the size of any material is comparable with its Compton’s wavelength, it exhibits \nnanoproperty and the materials are called Nanomaterial. This is found to be the order \n10-9 m. This is the reason why these materials exhibit nanoproperty. Thus, we come \nto the conclusion that as we move from macro to nano dimensions, we observe the \nfollowing: \n \n1. There is an additional constraint in the movement of electrons and protons. \n2. There is reduction in the degree of freedom. \n \nTherefore, these materials are also called as materials of low dimensionality, in which \nthe charge density increases by decreasing the degree of freedom.

Effective reduction of geometry to two or fewer dimensional systems is \npossible by a strong spatial localisation to a plane, line or point( i.e. confinement of an \nelectron in at least one direction at the de-Broglie wavelength) occurs only in the case of \natoms and electrons localised on crystal imperfections( e.g. on impurities).  \n \nQuantum Wells are one of the three basic components of quantum devices, which are \nultra thin, quasi 3-D planes. A narrow strip sliced from one of the planes is a 1-D \nquantum wire. Dicing up a 1-D wire yields a 0-D quantum dot. Reducing the number of \ndimensions in this manner forces electron to behave in a more atom like manner. All the \nthree devices mentioned are the quantum devices i.e. they have nanostructures. Thus, we \ncan say that with the evolution of nanotechnology comes the era of Diminishing \ndimensions from 3-dimensions, which was commonly found, to 2-dimensions in the form \nof Quantum Wells.

All these problems are still present in the quantum \nversion of the theory and appear in an even more complicated manner. In the last ten \ndecades, even since Lorentz identified the problem in 1903, a number of attempts have \nbeen made to circumvent divergence problem of Classical Electrodynamics. Out of all \nthe prescriptions, the renormalization technique and Rohrlich procedure of invoking \nboundary conditions have drawn special attention. During the course of present \ninvestigation, I am bringing to the forefront an attempt which has been made to \nreformulate the theory of electricity and magnetism. In the process, a simple but an \nelegant prescription proposed by Prof. Y M Gupta has been used. For the development of \nproposed formalism a stand has been taken that the problem as enunciated above must be \nsolved initially at the classical level and only then the reformulation be carried forward to \nthe quantum level. This procedural development automatically ensures the basic stringent \nrequirement that the future theory must be a covering theory of the present one: invoking \nBohr Correspondence Principle- “In the limit when the proposed modification is \nwithdrawn, the proposed theory reduces to the existing one.” \n \nThe proposed formalism is based on the observation that in the realm of known \nformalism of Classical Electrodynamics potential function, field intensity, field \nmomentum and interaction force, all, are singular at the origin(R=0) i.e. all these physical \nquantities become infinite in the limit of zero distance. It is this singularity, which is the \ncrux of the problem. In the present formalism we choose a potential function such that it \nis suitably and correctly chosen such that it is regular at the origin as well as all other \nspace points, we automatically get physical quantities free from singularity. This is a \nlogical way to obtain a whole set of dependent quantities which are regular ab initio. But \nat the same time it is also clear that all attempts at changing the basic equations of \nElectrodynamics (Maxwell equations) have proved unsuccessful. As a matter of fact, it is \nrequired to keep the basic equations of electrodynamics intact and yet look for a suitable \npotential function (solution of basic equations) that provides divergence-free solutions to \nthe problems of Classical Electrodynamics (field energy, field intensity, field momentum \netc.). To achieve this objective, prescriptions proposed by Prof. Y M Gupta have been \nfollowed. The important features of the prescriptions are- \n \n1. The basic equations of Electrodynamics (Maxwell equations) remain intact. \n2. The form of potential function, as obtained, is such that it is regular at all \nspace points including origin. Notwithstanding this, it also gives rise to field \nintensities, field energies and interaction forces that are regular at all space \npoints ab initio. \n3. No free parameter is introduced into the theory- it is basically a parameter free \ntheory. \n4. The prescription very gently obeys Bohr Correspondence Principle. In other \nwords, in the limit of large distances the proposed potential function reduces \nto usual Coulomb potential function. \n5. The prescription is quite general in nature and not restricted to \nelectrodynamics alone. Indeed, it can be applied to any inverse square force \nlaw. (E.g. Newtonian gravitational force and Yukawa Nuclear force.) \n \nWhen the whole problem is analysed very closely, it is observed that the crux of the \nproblem in hidden in the fact that in the realm of known formalism of classical"

As the systems keep on becoming smaller and \nsmaller the potential function of the system changes at a particular radius and \nassumes a different form. The length at which the potential function changes form is \ndetermined by the Compton Wavelength of the system. Thus the Compton \nwavelength plays a major role in determining the modification in potential function. \nThe modified Coulomb potential is given by: \nV = ½ kh r2 –V0 for r < rc   \n   = -1/4π0 e2/r   for r> rc \nWhere rc determines the size of quantum dot, rc is in the range of 10nm to 100nm, this \nhas been experimentally determined."

It is a very general term \nwith regard to physical systems. There are various symmetries in Nature like local space \ntime symmetries and global space time symmetries. Global space time symmetries apply \nto all the laws of Physics. Here in this section we will attempt to give a direction on \nwhich a further thought can be developed for the resolution of the famous Measurement \nProblem in Quantum Mechanics. It is the Measurement Problem which lies at the heart of \nvarious problems and observation anomalies in Quantum Mechanics. Here I am trying to \ngive an explanation of Measurement Problem using Symmetry breaking process. The \nbasic equation of Quantum Mechanics i.e. AB ≠ BA valid for conjugate variables shows \nsome kind of irreversibility in the system. Now by the Leibniz’s Principle of Sufficient \nReason (PSR): If there is no sufficient reason for one thing to happen instead of another, \nthe principle says that nothing happens or in a situation with certain symmetry evolves in \nsuch a way that, in the absence of an asymmetric cause, the initial symmetry is preserved. \nIn other words, a breaking of initial symmetry cannot happen without a reason or an \nasymmetry cannot originate spontaneously. Asymmetry is what creates a phenomenon. \nThus symmetry breaking follows Principle of Causality that is “For every effect there is a \ncause.” By the Measurement process we purposefully throw the Quantum System as a \n“choice of information” by the observer unlike the collapsing of the wave function into \nan uncertain Eigen state. Thus in a Measurement process the system does not lose \ninformation like classical systems but is thrown in a particular eigen state based on the \ninformation choice made by the observer. Hence we need to introduce a parameter in \nQuantum Mechanics which takes care of this “choice of information” rather the “loss of \ninformation” whose parameter is entropy in classical mechanics. Curie’s Principle also is \nan interesting way to represent symmetry requirements in a system. The symmetry \nelements of the causes must be found in their effects, but the converse is not true, that is \nthe effects can be more symmetric then their causes. Conditions valid for Curie’s \nPrinciple are: \n1. The causal connection must be valid. \n2. Cause and Effect and their respective symmetries must be well defined. \nThe there must be a sufficient reason for the Measurement Problem to occur and by the \nLeibniz’s Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) we can conclude that there must be some \nsymmetry breaking phenomenon occurring as a reason for the asymmetry in the system \nand thus leading to Measurement Problem. Thus it is a matter of further research to find \nthe precise way how symmetry breaks in the system? What type of symmetry exists? Is it \na local or a global symmetry which breaks in the Reduction(R) Process of the wave \nfunction as it is called in the Quantum Mechanics parlance? Thus introducing symmetry \nin the Reduction Process in Quantum Mechanics is a novel idea and can put some more \nlight into the reason and the precise process by which wave function collapse occurs. \nThus this may fundamentally give the reason of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It is"

In the second case we can keep Hamiltonian (H) as it is and change the definition \nof wave function (ψ) by introducing a δ term to account for correlation effect of \nEPR states. \nHence we have attempted the second case in our formalism of accounting for correlation \nin the definition of wave function (ψ) of the system. Though both the approaches are new \nto the scene and have not been attempted for this type of a situation. Hence the \napplication of first case is an area of further research in this formalism. \n Eigen states are essentially entangled or correlated in an EPR situation and since EPR \nimplies non-local communication and apparent breakdown of Heisenberg Uncertainty \nPrinciple hence it may lead to the modification of Linear Superposition Principle’s \nlinearity gets violated and different eigen states start interfering with each other and lead \nto the introduction of δ in the definition of wave function (ψ). \n \nEPR states              modification of Linear Superposition Principle             new definition \nof wave function (ψ) or introduction of a new parameter altogether. \n \nWe find from the above two possible scenarios that EPR correlation can be incorporated \nin the Schrodinger time dependent wave Eq. by modifying the Hamiltonian and \nintroducing the δ term due to correlation i e.

This can be reformulated in a \nstatement including dynamical variables position (x) and momentum (p) as  \n       “Both position (x) & momentum (p) can be measured to any desired accuracy.” \n \n2. \nIn Quantum Mechanics we have the fundamental Uncertainty Principle given by: \n          \n           \n \n \n∆x.∆p >= h/2π \n     It is interpreted as “ Either position (x) or momentum (p) can be measured with \ndesired accuracy but not both at the same time.” \n \n3. \nHere we give a new line of thinking to the above formalisms by saying that: \n \n“Neither position (x) nor momentum (p) to any degree of accuracy can be \nmeasured.”  \n \n This is a very interesting statement since in case 1 above we have determinism in the \ndefinition of the system. In case 2 we have probability but still it is limited probability \nsince one of the parameters can still be measured to desired degree of accuracy. But in \ncase 3 we have brought in a complete indeterminism in which both the variables are \ncompletely indeterministic. This formalism requires a new definition of Schrodinger \nWave Eq., Uncertainty Principle etc. It may be possible that Quantum Mechanics is a \nspecial case of this third mechanics as we move from complete indeterminism to limited \nindeterminism (Quantum Mechanics) to complete determinism (Classical Mechanics). \nThis concept of complete indeterminism may be related in some way to Consciousness of \nthe observer which is hot area of research in Quantum Mechanics these days. This last \nproposal was given by Stephen Hawking as a new direction of thinking on the \nmodification of Quantum Mechanics right at the fundamental level. \n \n5.4 Conclusion and Future Scope \n \nThe foundations of the subject of quantum computation have become well established, \nbut everything else required for its future growth is under exploration. That covers \nquantum algorithms, logic gate operations, error correction, understanding dynamics and \ncontrol of decoherence, atomic scale technology and worthwhile applications. \nReversibility of quantum computation may help in solving NP problems, which are easy \nin one direction but hard in the opposite sense. Global minimization problems may \nbenefit from interference effects (as seen in Fermat’s principle in wave mechanics). \nSimulated annealing methods may improve due to quantum tunneling through barriers. \nPowerful properties of complex numbers (analytic functions, conformal mappings) may \nprovide new algorithms. Theoretical tools for handling many-body quantum \nentanglement are not well developed. Its improved characterization may produce better \nimplementation of quantum logic gates and possibilities to correct correlated errors."

    "text": "37\nThough decoherence can be described as an effective process, its dynamics is not \nunderstood but an attempt has been made in the present project work in the form of \nSymmetry breaking argument or need for an entropy like parameter or function to \naccount for irreversibility in the system. To be able to control decoherence, one should be \nable to figure out the eigenstates favored by the environment in a given setup. The \ndynamics of measurement process in not understood fully, though the attempt is also \nmade in this regard in this project. Measurement is just described as a non-unitary \nprojection operator in an otherwise unitary quantum theory. Ultimately both the system \nand the observer are made up of quantum building blocks, and a unified quantum \ndescription of both measurement and decoherence must be developed. Apart from \ntheoretical gain, it would help in improving the detectors that operate close to the \nquantum limit of observation. For the physicist, it is of great interest to study the \ntransition from classical to quantum regime. Enlargement of the system from microscopic \nto mesoscopic levels, and reduction of the environment from macroscopic to mesoscopic \nlevels, can take us there. If there is something beyond quantum theory lurking, there it \nwould be noticed in the struggle for making quantum devices. We may discover new \nlimitations of quantum theory in trying to conquer decoherence. Theoretical \ndevelopments alone will be no good without a matching technology. Nowadays, the race \nfor miniaturization of electronic circuits in not too far away from the quantum reality of \nnature. To devise new types of instruments, we must change our view-points from \nscientific to technological-quantum effects which are not for only observation; we should \nlearn how to control them for practical use. The future is not foreseen yet, but it is \ndefinitely promising. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1. \nK.Brading, and E.Castellani (2003), Symmetries in Physics: Philosophical \nReflections, Cambridge University Press, 2003. \n2. \nSanjeev Kumar (2002), Reformulation of Classical Electrodynamics, Jiwaji \nUniversity, Gwalior, INDIA. \n3. \nMichael Nielsen, and Isaac Chuang, Quantum Computation, Cambridge \nUniversity Press."
